      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>STEM Atlas was created by a high school student who wanted to make it easier for other students to find opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math—especially free and low-cost ones. The goal is to help everyone, regardless of background, discover what’s possible in STEM.</p>

      <h2>Why STEM Atlas?</h2>
      <p>This project began with a passion for civil engineering and accessibility. Students shouldn't have to dig through dozens of websites just to find out about one robotics camp or internship. STEM Atlas puts it all in one place and allows students and educators to contribute too.</p>
